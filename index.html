<h1> Personal page</h1>
<p>I like sitting on the swing. Its very peaceful and it calms my mind down. I usually like to swing during sunsets, its beautiful to see the different colors of the sky other than blue. I really like swings and any types of swings. Sometimes i like to swing high and feel the tickles, and other times i like to slowly swing usually having my ipad in my hand for entertainment. I swing for a while until my legs get sore from swinging. In the balcony of my house i have a hamock which is also a type of swing, and spend most of my day on there, its my favorite place to be. Usually in the morning its sunny and the sun hits my face so i try to avoid it that time, i like going at sunset time and night time. After i finish my homework and being all stressed i go outside on my sing for a while and rest,then get sad when its time to sleep and go back inside <h1/>
